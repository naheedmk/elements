# Elements

## Introduction

Elements is a framework that is used to build applications.  With it, an application consists of many components (which are called Atoms).  To create an application, one only has to declare a set of Atoms and a "provision" file that references them.  Within an Atom, the objects' inter-dependencies are wired using dependency injection and their properties are configured using YAML.  In a way, it is similar to the Spring Framework.  However, it does away with XML and allows developers to use Groovy directly whenever necessary.  The end result is that the configuration files are much more terse and flexible.  

When compared to Spring Boot, Elements stays away from configuration in code, i.e. via annotations.  Rather, the prefer method is to use a provision file and Atoms.  The fundamental philosophy is that given a set of Atoms, one can deploy different applications using different provision files.  The bottom line is that it aims to be simpler and less verbose than Spring and it allows configuration using groovy scripts so that with a deployment bundle, one can employ different provision files to start different applications.  Think of it as analogous to Java's WORA (write once, run anywhere), but in this case BORA (build once, run applications)

Finally, Elements comes with a set of easy to use Atoms that allow developers to quickly set up database thread pools, JPA, Hibernate, RESTful services etc.  In fact, one of the most sophisticated payment system, Tritium by Episode Six, was built using Elements.

## Resources and ResourceManager
When a provision file is loaded, it is associated with an instance of ResourceManager.  The ResourceManager serves three purposes.  First, it is for binding classes or singletons so that they are always available during dependency injection.  Second, it is for creating Resources instances.  A ResourceManger can be configured with a number of ResourceProviders via Atoms.  During a call to open a Resources instance, it coordinates with all of the ResourceProviders so that resources, such as a database transaction, are open.  When the Resources instance is committed or aborted, the ResourceProviders are responsible for committing or aborting the resources they manage.  Third, it is a centralized registry for POJOs.  Objects can be registered with a ResourceManager by name for other objects to look up.  

An example of using Resources would be declaring it as an injection point for a RESTful service.  When a method is called, the Resources instance would be open.  Once the call is completed, it would either be committed or aborted depending on whether an exception was thrown.  Below is a simple example showing using a Resources instance to retrieve a JPA EntityManager.  In this case, it is assumed a ResourceProvider for JPA EntityManager has already been registered with the ResourceManager.

    public class Restful {
        @Inject
        private Resources resources;
        
        @POST
        @Produces({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON})
        @Path("person")
        public Person createPerson(Person person) {
            EntityManager em = resources.getInstance(EntityManager.class);
            em.persist(person);
            return Person;
        }
    }

### Resources Open/Commit/Abort
For calls on non-singleton RESTful services, Resources management is done automatically.  However, there are many cases that the code needs to manage Resources, for instance, singleton RESTful services and cron jobs.  First the object needs to be injected with a Provision:

    @Inject
    Provision provision;
    
The code then can use the Provision instance to commit a closure.  The decision to use closures hinges on the ability to control open and commit/abort resources cleanly.  More importantly, it also allows the closure to be retried if an exception is thrown.

The Provision class has several commit methods that take various instance lookup parameters.  In the simplest form, it takes no lookup parameters.

	// no parameters
    provision.commit(()-> {
        // do something
    })
    
The one parameter version is a convenient method and is equivalent to opening a Resources instance and looks up a bound instance and provides it to the closure.  Ditto for methods with higher number of parameters.

    // one parameter example
    provision.commit(Resources.class, (resources)-> {
        Person person = resources.newInstance(Person.class);
    })
    
    // two parameters example
    provision.commit(DataSource.class, EntityManager.class, (ds, em)-> {
       ...
    })

The general flow of the commit call is the following

* Creates an instance of Resources
* For each ResourceProvider, open its resources
* Executes the closure
* If success, for each ResourceProvider, commits its resources.
* If failed, for each ResourceProvider, aborts its resources.
* If Retry is supported, repeat the process until retry count has reached.

### Resources Retry

## Provision File
A provision file is a start up script and it is responsible for loading Atoms or other Groovy scripts. The example below shows a simple provision file.

    exec "$__dir/variables.groovy",
        "$__dir/persist.groovy",
        "$__dir/jobs/**",
        "$__dir/restful/**"

It executes all of the groovy scripts in the *$__dir/../jobs* and *$__dir/../restful* directories, and *persist.groovy*.  The variable *__dir* is automatically set to the directory that contains the script currently being executed.  It uses Ant's directory syntax: ** means files in all subdirectories where as * means just files in the directory.

### Launching a Provision
To launch a provision file, the general syntax is
    
    java -cp <classpath> net.e6tech.elements.common.launch.Launch 
        launch=<path to the provision file> end

As one may surmise, you can launch more than one provision file.  Remember, each provision file is associated with its own ResourceManager.

### Atom
An Atom file is a Groovy script that contains declarations for Atoms.  Here is an very simple Atom for providing two RESTful services: HelloWorld and Goodbye.

    import ...JaxRSServer
    import ...Utility
    
    atom("helloworld") {
        configuration =  """
        _helloWorld.addresses:
            - "http://0.0.0.0:9001/restful/"
        _helloWorld.resources:
            - class: "net.e6tech.sample.web.cxf.HelloWorld"
              singleton: false
            - class: "net.e6tech.sampl.web.cxf.Goodbye"
              singleton: true
        _utility: 
            name: just an example
            count: 3
     """
     
        _utility = Utility
        _helloWorld = JaxRSServer
    }
    

The Java implementation of HelloWorld, 

    @Path("/helloworld")
    public class HelloWorld {
    
        @Inject
        ResourceManager resourceManager;
        
        @Inject
        Utility util;
    
        @Inject
        Resources resources;
    
        @GET
        @Produces({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON})
        @Path("get/{id}")
        public String getHello(@PathParam("id") int id) {
            EntityManager em = resources.getInstance(EntityManager.class);
            // do something with em, for example lookup an entity using the id.
            String ret =  ...
            return ret;
        }
    }

Atom must have a name and it must be unique so that it won't be loaded twice.  Within an Atom, the first section is configuration and it is a multiline YAML string that is used to configure POJOs.  POJOs are declared after the configuration section.  The syntax is 'name = <Java Class>'.  The naming convention is very important in that for a POJO of which name STARTS with a underscore, it is NOT registered with the ResourceManager.  In general, A POJO's name should start with a underscore unless there is a particular reason to register it so that other objects from different Atoms can look it up by name.  However, please note that it is better to use injection instead of named lookup and to keep interdependencies local.

As mentioned, the YAML string is used to configured POJOs.  In this example, _helloworld is declared to be an instance of JaxRSServer so that at this point of the script, an instance of JaxRSServer is  instantiated.  It has two fields, addresses (List<String>) and resources (List<Map<String, Object>>), and they are set up by the "_helloword" section of the YAML string.

In this example, it also demonstrates injection.  HelloWord requires a Utility instance to be injected.  By declaring a Utility instance in the Atom, it is automatically injected into _helloworld and it must be noted that because of the dependency, the Utility instance must be declared first.  Circular dependencies are allowed only if the Inject's optional is set to true.  In such a case, the order of declaration is not important.

    
## Resource Providers
ResourceProviders are used to control the opening and closing of resources.  To register a ResourceProvider, simply declare the provider within an atom and it is automatically picked up by the ResourceManager.

### Hibernate Resource Provider
For an enterprise application, an important task is management of database transactions.  Elements provides a ResourceProvider to manage transactions and JPA EntityManager.  In this section, we will go over the basics of creating an Atom for the ResourceProvider.
 
But first, we must have a DataSource.  Elements provides support for Hikari database connection pool out of the box.

    atom("datasource") {
    configuration = """
        dataSource:
            driverClassName: org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
            username: test
            password: password
            jdbcUrl: "jdbc:mariadb://127.0.0.1:3306/h3"
    """
        dataSource = HikariDataSource
    }
    
Once a DataSource is created, the Atom below shows how to configure a Hibernate JPA provider using HibernateEntityManagerProvider. Since it is a subclass of ResourceProvider, it is automatically registered with the ResourceManager.
    
    atom("persist") {
    configuration = """
        entityManagerProvider.persistenceUnitName: h3
        entityManagerProvider.transactionTimeout: ${entityManagerTxTimeout}
        entityManagerProvider.monitorTransaction: ${entityManagerMonitorTransaction}
        entityManagerProvider.longTransaction: ${entityManagerLongTransaction}
        entityManagerProvider.persistenceProperties:
            javax.persistence.nonJtaDataSource: ^dataSource
    """
    
        entityManagerProvider = HibernateEntityManagerProvider

        postInit {
            // testing if EntityManager can be created correctly
            open({ resources ->
                EntityManager em = resources.getInstance(EntityManager)
                resources.abort()
            })
        }
    }

There are some features in the Atom that we need to highlight.  First, variables enclosed by ${} are replaced with their actual value.  For example, we see ${entityManagerTxTimeout} in the configuration.  Therefore, entityManagerTxTimeout must be defined somewhere so that its value can be used.  In practice, all configuration variables should be aggregated into a Groovy file and be referenced at the beginning of the provision file.  Second, a variable begins with ^ means the actual value would come from a name look up from the ResourceManager.  In the example, ^dataSource would resolve to the DataSource declared in a different Atom.  Last, the *postInit* section is used to run the closure once all of the objects in an Atom has been created, injected, configured and initialized.  In this example, the *postInit* runs a closure to make sure an EntityManager can be retrieved successfully.

### Persistence XML
After we have created the JPA ResourceProvider, the rest of the work is standard JPA configuration.  First, there must be a file named *persistence.xml* located in the class path under META-INF.  It should look like a standard Hibernate flavored JPA XML file.  The important entry is the value for *hibernate.ejb.cfgfile*, which should point to the location of the Hibernate configuration file.

A very important point to note about this type of configuration file and the Hibernate configuration file is that variables enclosed in ${} need to be defined in System properties, not a Groovy script, because they are part of standard JPA and Hibernate configuration, not Elements.

    <persistence xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence"
             xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence classpath://xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_1.xsd"
             version="2.1">
      <persistence-unit name="h3">
        <provider>org.hibernate.jpa.HibernatePersistenceProvider</provider>
        <exclude-unlisted-classes>true</exclude-unlisted-classes>
        <shared-cache-mode>ENABLE_SELECTIVE</shared-cache-mode>
        <properties>
            <property name="hibernate.ejb.cfgfile" value="persistence/h3/h3.cfg.xml" />
            <property name="current_session_context" value="thread" />
            <property name="hibernate.cache.use_query_cache" value="false" />
            <property name="hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache" value="false" />
        </properties>
      </persistence-unit>
    </persistence>

### Hibernate Configuration
This file is a standard Hibernate configuration file and the only notable entry is the session scoped interceptor.  The interceptor's main job is to publish changes to entities to other members of the cluster.  Yes, Elements supports clustering and database caching so that changes can be propagated to members of the cluster.

    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>

    <>hibernate-configuration>
      <session-factory name="h3">
          <!-- properties -->
          <property name="dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL57InnoDBDialect</property>
          <property name="show_sql">${hibernate.show_sql}</property>
          <property name="hibernate.connection.isolation">2</property>
          <property name="hibernate.cache.use_query_cache">true</property>
          <property name="hibernate.cache.region.factory_class">org.hibernate.cache.ehcache.SingletonEhCacheRegionFactory</property>
          <property name="hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache">${hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache}</property>
          <!--<property name="hibernate.cache.use_structured_entries">true</property>-->
          <property name="hibernate.generate_statistics">${hibernate.generate_statistics}</property>
          <property name="hibernate.archive.autodetection">false</property>
          <property name="hibernate.ejb.interceptor.session_scoped">net.e6tech.elements.persist.hibernate.Interceptor</property>

          <!-- mapping files -->
          <mapping resource="persistence/h3/mappings/account.hbm.xml"/>
        ...
      </session-factory>
    </hibernate-configuration>

 ### Catalyst
 Catalyst is a framework that leverages Akka Clustering and allows the user to break up work into smaller pieces in order to distribute them to other nodes for processing.  
 
 A typical Catalyst request looks like the following
 
     Catalyst catalyst = new SimpleCatalyst("acme", registry);
     catalyst.setWaitTime(1000000L);
     DataSet<Integer> dataSet = prepareDateSet();
     Series<Reactor, Integer, Long> t = Series.from(new MapTransform<>((reactor, number) ->
              (long) (number * number)));
     DataSet<Long> result = catalyst.builder(dataSet)
              .add(new MapTransform<>((reactor, number) -> (long) (number * number)))
              .transform();
     
 First, one creates a data set and a Series instance.  The purpose of Series is to perform a number of transformation on the data set.  During the building phase, the user can add a number of Transforms to the Series.  Finally, when the transform method is invoked, Catalyst breaks the data set into several chunks depending on the number of available cluster nodes.  Each chunk and the Transforms are sent to a separate node for execution.  Once processing is done by all of the nodes, Catalyst assembles the results and return it to the caller.
 
 
 #### Transform
 The available Transforms are listed below
 
 * Fitler
 * FlatMap
 * Intersection
 * MapTransform
 * Union
 
 In addition, one can always create a customized Transform class by implementing a method.
 
     Stream<R> transform(Re reactor, Stream<T> stream)
     
Re is the type of Reactor.
 
 #### Scalar
 
 In addition to transforming a data set, Catalyst also supports reducing it to a scalar value.  For example, the code below finds the max value from the data set.
 
    Double max = catalyst.builder(remoteDataSet)
                 .add(new MapTransform<>((operator, number) ->
                 Math.sin(number * Math.PI / 360)))
                 .scalar(new Max<>());
              
Below is a list of available Scalar functions.  Of course, one can always subclass the Scalar class to provide customized behavior.            
 * Count
 * Distinct
 * Max
 * Min
 * Reduce
 * Scalar
